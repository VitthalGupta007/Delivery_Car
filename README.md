# Delivery_Car

Introduction
Welcome to the Delivery Car Game! Dive into an endless world as a delivery car driver, pick up packages, and race to deliver them to eager customers. But the road isn’t all smooth – capture speed boosts and avoid colliding with obstacles!

Features
Dynamic Colors: On picking up a package, the car changes its color, signaling its loaded state.
Speed Orbs: Collect the yellow orbs scattered around to get a temporary speed boost.
Watch Out for Obstacles: Navigate carefully! Bumping into buildings or objects will decelerate your car.
Deliver to the Blue: The customer is marked in blue. Drive your loaded car to them to complete the delivery.


How To Play
Controls: Navigate your car with arrow keys or W, A, S, D.
Pick Up & Deliver: Drive over a package to pick it up and then locate a blue customer for delivery.
Speed Boost: Grab the yellow orbs for a quick speed burst.
